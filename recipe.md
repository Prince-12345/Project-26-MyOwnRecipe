**Recipe for maing samosa is here-**

Wash and boil 500 g of potatoes until just done. Then grind them and set aside. 

Take a bowl and add 2 cups of maida, 3/4 teaspoon ajwain, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup oil. Now mix them well. After some time of mixing, add required amount of teaspoons of water and begin to form a dough ball

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan. Next, add 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds. When the seeds begin to splutter, add 1 tablespoop minced ginger, 1 to 2 chopped green chilles and a pinch of hing.

Now add 3/4 teaspoon red chilli powder, 3/4 to 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saute for 30 seconds and then add green peas. Saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Then add potatoes.

Saute the entire potato masala for 2 to 3 minutes until potatoes blend well with spice powders. Add 1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves. Taste it and add salt if required. After this set them aside to cool.

Now, knead the dough and divide it into big equal parts. Take a rolling board, oil the surface, place a dough ball and roll it to an even size of oval shape. Now cut it into two equal parts and roll it little bit. Apply water with your fingers onthe edges of a semi-circle. Join the edges to make a cone shape and stick them well. Now fill the cone with potato masala, apply water on edges and seal the samosa very well.

Now you can either bake or fry the samosas. 

*Bake*  Preheat the oven to 360 F or 180 C for 20minutes. Brush oil gnerously and bake them for 30-40 minutes, flipping them after 15 minutes.

*Fry*  Heat a pan with oil for deep frying. The oil should not be very hot or smok hot. It must be medium hot. Now gently slide the samosas one by one slowy. After you add them to the hot oil, you must see very tiny bubbles rising slowly. Add 4 or 5 together. Do not disturb them for few minutes. Later when they come up, kep strring occasonally and fry them evenly until golden.

Half way through, the crust begins to firm up, then increase the heat a bit. Don't rush. They will take a lot of time to fry golden.

When the samosas turn golden, remove them to a bowl with tissue papers to absorb excess oil. For the next turn bring down the heat and then add other.

Serve samosas with mint, chutney, sweet tamarind or tomato sauce as you wish.
